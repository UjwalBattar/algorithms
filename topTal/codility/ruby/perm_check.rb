# A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
#
# A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N
# once, and only once.
#
# For example, array A such that:
#
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 2
# is a permutation, but array A such that:
#
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
# is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.
#
# The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(A);
#
# that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and
# 0 if it is not.
#
# For example, given array A such that:
#
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 2
# the function should return 1.
#
# Given array A such that:
#
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
# the function should return 0.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range
# [1..1,000,000,000].
